# Smash it

## Purpose
This is a demo game where physics have been tested whitout using no framework.
Also No task runner has been used, only npm scripts.

## Running the project

### Server
Clone the project and once dowloaded do to the folder project and there execute the next command:

```bash
$ npm run server
```

Also you can run the project with `npm run server:prod`, the main difference is all files will be optimized.

If you like to have files watched (scripts and styles) it's better to run :

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

### Compile
If you look for only compile the project then run:

```bash
$ npm run build:prod
```

If you like to have the same result but no optimized files the run `npm run build`.
